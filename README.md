### Algorithem we used 
In this project we were asked to do three different functions that find the minimum sequence in three different types of algorithms.

## Example
### Input

  + ***Word -*** bee
  +  ***Text -***  I’m bringing home my baby bumble bee
                  Won’t my Mommy be so proud of me
                I’m bringing home my baby bumble bee 
                        OUCH!! It stung me!!~

### Output
 + ***Gematria Sequences:*** l~e be~bee~l~e be~bee
 + ***Atbash Sequences :***
 + ***Anagram Sequences:*** e be~bee~e be~bee
